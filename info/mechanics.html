        <h1 id="mechanics"><a href="#mechanics">Gameplay Mechanics</a></h1>

        <p class="text-muted">
          Game rules and structure should go here. You may not need this page, in which case, feel free to delete, replace, or rename it. Here is an example:
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="structure"><a href="#structure">Game Structure</a></h2>
        <p>[Name] is a <strong>limited time game</strong>. This means that there is a pre-determined beginning and end of the roleplay campaign, and that players will progress through the story in a structured way.</p>

        <h2 id="progression"><a href="#progression">Progression</a></h2>
        <p>This game will consist of a <strong>Prologue</strong>, <strong>four to five Chapters</strong>, and an <strong>Endgame</strong>.</p>
        <p>The Prologue will last&nbsp;<strong>14 days</strong>. It is an opportunity for characters to form pre-established connections with one another beforehand.</p>
        <p>Normal chapters will have:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>12 days / Threading</strong><br />A phase of threaded roleplay, where players can thread or complete assignments while a minor external factor is applied to the scenario to drive them towards plot and development.</li>
          <li><strong>3 days / Outcome</strong><br />An event where players are placed into groups to deal with antagonistic forces, solve puzzles, and resolve the plot of the chapter.</li>
          <li><strong>5 days / Interim<br /></strong>A phase of downtime, to allow the players a breather and give moderators a chance to set up the next chapter. Players may also submit 'summary' posts to the blog in the form of a report filed in-character. Threaded roleplay is allowed, but there are no roleplay expectations for this phase.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>During threaded roleplay phases, players focus on 1x1 roleplays among other members of the cast (these can be longform, shortform, chat RP, or headcanons) but may also participate in group chat RP and activities that moderators host.</p>
        <p>It's important to build relationships and set up personal developments in the threading phases to have an impactful Outcome!</p>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="roles"><a href="#roles">Power Roles and Hooks</a></h2>
        <p>In [Name], there will be no single "mastermind" role. The campaign is intended to have a<strong> "Player vs Event"</strong> style of storytelling, similar to tabletop games, and each character has an <strong>equal opportunity for agency</strong> in affecting the plot.</p>
        <p>That being said, <strong>we encourage players to create hooks into the world to give them a spin on the plot</strong>. For example, characters may veer towards more selfish or antagonistic with ties to self-serving organizations, or they may be more altruistic and helpful, with connections to entities that may affect the overall plot.</p>
        <p>We would like each character to draft a sort of "ace" up their sleeve or a "development" that may reveal itself organically over the course of the plot. <strong>These hooks will be part of our process in building a roster that hopefully encourages character connections</strong>, past, present, or future. These hooks will also serve to build the Outcomes that characters will face, with multiple character arcs being pulled together and hopefully resolved in each chapter.</p>
        <p>That all being said– while moderators will be doing their very best to balance the spotlight between all the members of our roster, <strong>not all plot hooks are guaranteed to be used in the duration of the campaign</strong>. We ask that applicants remain flexible and open to potential changes as developments occur, but we also want to strongly encourage players to reach out should they feel anxiety or dissatisfaction with their character's participation.</p>
        <p>Communication is key to a fun storytelling experience.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="casing"><a href="#casing">Casing</a></h2>
        <p>To reiterate, each chapter's Threading and Outcome phase will be planned based on a few characters' Hooks.</p>
        <p><strong>Players and Characters involved in the planning of a chapter will be called Casers</strong>. Casers volunteer before the chapter begins. They will spend the Control phase plotting the rest of the chapter with the moderators. The Outcome will focus on resolving their character arcs.</p>
        <p>Note that it takes a fair amount of time and work to case, and you get exactly what you put in. Casers will also be expected to collaborate with other cases in the same chapter to create a story that is a) engaging for the unsuspecting and b) satisfying for all casers.</p>
        <p><strong>You may only case ONCE in the game</strong>. <strong>You are also expected to continue to participate in the game even after you've cased</strong>, to give everyone else the same amount of attention and investment as they gave you.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="checks"><a href="#checks">Vibe Checks</a></h2>
        <p>From the beginning, players and characters are encouraged to explore the world and the plot.</p>
        <p><strong>Once per chapter, players' characters can do an investigative 'vibe check'.</strong> Depending on the nature of the check, they may receive hints about the world building, insight on the plot, fun tidbits, or foreshadowing for upcoming cases.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Checks <strong>must be performed in a thread.</strong> They can be in public or private threads. You can also do a headcanon check!</li>
          <li>You must <strong>@ the moderators for the check.</strong> They may ask for clarifying information, demand a requirement, or roll a dice for an outcome.</li>
          <li>Checks will usually require you to <strong>meet a certain threshold in a stat to pass.</strong></li>
          <li>The initiator is the one doing the check, but anyone in the thread can lend their stats to support your character without it counting for their chapterly check.</li>
          <li>If you fail a check and the moderators deem it an <em>important</em> check, characters will get a hint on what stat is needed to pass. It is up to you if you want to recruit other characters later and return to the check, or if you want to give the opportunity to someone else altogether.</li>
          <li>If your character DOES give the check to someone else altogether, note that the recipient becomes the initiator whose chapterly check is spent and the original discoverer can try checking elsewhere.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is up to your character if they want to share information they learn through checks or not. There will also be a spoilers channel for you to share discoveries OOC, if you'd like.</p>
        <p>Lastly, moderators will be privy to all roleplay threads and may volunteer events or information if they deem it applicable. Moderators will post to ask before they intervene in a thread.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="death"><a href="#death">Permadeath, Replacement, and Withdrawal</a></h2>
        <p>It should be noted that while there is the potential of permadeath in this game, <strong>we discourage players from killing off their characters</strong> for shock value. Moderators will be hard pressed to accept a character death unless we feel it's handled appropriately and suits the arc of the character.</p>
        <p>That being said, we do not want to force players to play the game if they don't vibe with the game, they end up not enjoying their character, or they become tied up in real life obligations. <em>Roleplay is not a job</em>, it is a hobby first and foremost.</p>
        <p>During the Prologue phase, you may discuss replacement or withdrawal with the moderating team.&nbsp;You can <strong>appeal for a replacement</strong> using another hopeful you already applied with, but we may decline the appeal if the character does not suit our planned plot, roster chemistry, or rules. <strong>This should be a last resort</strong>– if you try to appeal for a replacement, we will assume that you otherwise wish to leave the game if we cannot accommodate your replacement request and we will proceed with processing your withdrawal.</p>
        <p>Once the game begins in earnest, you may not pitch replacement, but we would prefer inactive members formally withdraw rather than remaining inactive. If you do so, we will write your character out by having them vanish– but <strong>not through death</strong>, as death events require a large amount of emotional investment and time on behalf of the mods and other players.</p>
